I will predict whether an individual earns more than $ 50,000 per year. The label is income_binary of >50K or <=50K. This is a supervised learning problem because we have labeled outcomes such as income_binary. Moreover, this is a classification problem because we want to predict discrete categories. This is also a binary classification problem as there are only two outcomes: >50K and <=50K. The features include age, workclass, education, occupation, relationship, etc. This is an important problem because a company could use this model to offer personalized products through loans and credit cards as well as section their consumers based on income level.
